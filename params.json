I know, it sounds cool.\r\n\r\n### Learning Purpose\r\nThis project is being developed purely to support the creators in the process of learning Python. So do not make fun of us... we might call your parents.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWe do not give any kind of support (unless in the company that I work for... but it is not related to this anyway).\r\nIf you want to contact us, for some reason, here is my email: rabuske@outlook.com\r\n",
